# GitHub Copilot for Research Excellence - Excitement Day @ NUS

This guide provides an overview of GitHub Copilot and how it can accelerate your research workflows. It serves as a reference for the workshop presented at NUS.

## Getting Started with GitHub Copilot

### Installation in VS Code

1. Install the GitHub Copilot & GitHub Copilot Chat extensions on VS Code
2. Sign in to your GitHub account when prompted
3. Ensure you have an active GitHub Copilot subscription
4. Start coding with AI assistance!

### Best Practices for Researchers

- **Be specific in your comments**: Provide clear context about the research task you're trying to accomplish
- **Iterate on suggestions**: Treat Copilot suggestions as a starting point and refine as needed
- **Use pseudocode**: Outline your algorithms in comments or Chat before implementation
- **Request explanations**: Ask Copilot to explain complex code by adding a comment with your question
- **Learn from suggestions**: Study Copilot's code to improve your own programming skills

## 1. About GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less effort. It draws context from comments and code to suggest individual lines and whole functions instantly. Powered by advanced language models, GitHub Copilot understands both natural language and a vast array of programming languages.

For researchers, GitHub Copilot offers:

- **Accelerated coding** - spend less time on implementation details and more time on research
- **Simplified data processing** - quickly generate code for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
- **Effortless documentation** - easily document your research code and generate explanations
- **Language versatility** - works across Python, R and other research-focused languages
